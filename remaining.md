51. ### What are Angular elements?
    Angular elements are Angular components packaged as **custom elements** (a web standard for defining new HTML elements in a framework-agnostic way). Angular Elements host an Angular component, providing a bridge between the data and the logic defined in the component and the standard DOM APIs, thus, providing a way to use Angular components in `non-Angular environments`.

  **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

52. ### What is the browser support of Angular Elements?
    Since Angular elements are packaged as custom elements the browser support of angular elements is same as custom elements support.

    This feature is is currently supported natively in a number of browsers and pending for other browsers.

    | Browser | Angular Element Support |
    |---- | --------- |
    | Chrome | Natively supported|
    | Opera | Natively supported |
    | Safari| Natively supported |
    | Firefox | Natively supported from 63 version onwards. You need to enable dom.webcomponents.enabled and dom.webcomponents.customelements.enabled in older browsers |
    | Edge| Currently it is in progress|

  **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

53. ### What are custom elements?
    Custom elements (or Web Components) are a Web Platform feature which extends HTML by allowing you to define a tag whose content is created and controlled by JavaScript code. The browser maintains a `CustomElementRegistry` of defined custom elements, which maps an instantiable JavaScript class to an HTML tag. Currently this feature is supported by Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Safari, and available in other browsers through polyfills.

  **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

54. ### Do I need to bootstrap custom elements?
    No, custom elements bootstrap (or start) automatically when they are added to the DOM, and are automatically destroyed when removed from the DOM. Once a custom element is added to the DOM for any page, it looks and behaves like any other HTML element, and does not require any special knowledge of Angular.

  **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

55. ### Explain how custom elements works internally?
    Below are the steps in an order about custom elements functionality,
    1. **App registers custom element with browser:** Use the `createCustomElement()` function to convert a component into a class that can be registered with the browser as a custom element.
    2. **App adds custom element to DOM:**  Add custom element just like a built-in HTML element directly into the DOM.
    3. **Browser instantiate component based class:** Browser creates an instance of the registered class and adds it to the DOM.
    4. **Instance provides content with data binding and change detection:** The content with in template is rendered using the component and DOM data.
    The flow chart of the custom elements functionality would be as follows,

    ![CustomElement](images/customElement.png)

  **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

56. ### How to transfer components to custom elements?
    Transforming components to custom elements involves **two** major steps,
    1. **Build custom element class:** Angular provides the `createCustomElement()` function for converting an Angular component (along with its dependencies) to a custom element. The conversion process implements `NgElementConstructor` interface, and creates a constructor class which is used to produce a self-bootstrapping instance of Angular component.
    2. **Register element class with browser:** It uses `customElements.define()` JS function, to register the configured constructor and its associated custom-element tag with the browser's `CustomElementRegistry`. When the browser encounters the tag for the registered element, it uses the constructor to create a custom-element instance.

    The detailed structure would be as follows,
    ![CreateElement](images/createElement.png)

  **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

57. ### What are the mapping rules between Angular component and custom element?
    The Component properties and logic maps directly into HTML attributes and the browser's event system. Let us describe them in two steps,
    1. The createCustomElement() API parses the component input properties with corresponding attributes for the custom element. For example, component @Input('myInputProp') converted as custom element attribute `my-input-prop`.
    2. The Component outputs are dispatched as HTML Custom Events, with the name of the custom event matching the output name. For example, component @Output() valueChanged = new EventEmitter() converted as custom element with dispatch event as "valueChanged".

  **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

58. ### How do you define typings for custom elements?
    You can use the `NgElement` and `WithProperties` types exported from @angular/elements.

    Let's see how it can be applied by comparing with Angular component.
    1. The simple container with input property would be as below,
        ```javascript
        @Component(...)
        class MyContainer {
          @Input() message: string;
        }
        ```
    2. After applying types typescript validates input value and their types,
        ```javascirpt
        const container = document.createElement('my-container') as NgElement & WithProperties<{message: string}>;
        container.message = 'Welcome to Angular elements!';
        container.message = true;  // <-- ERROR: TypeScript knows this should be a string.
        container.greet = 'News';  // <-- ERROR: TypeScript knows there is no `greet` property on `container`.
        ```

59. ### What are dynamic components?
    Dynamic components are the components in which the component's location in the application is not defined at build time i.e. they are not used in any angular template. Instead, the component is instantiated and placed in the application at runtime.

75. ### What is Angular Universal?
    Angular Universal is a server-side rendering module for Angular applications in various scenarios. This is a community driven project and available under @angular/platform-server package. Recently Angular Universal is integrated with Angular CLI.

87. ### What is folding?
    The compiler can only resolve references to exported symbols in the metadata. Where as some of the non-exported members are folded while generating the code. i.e Folding is a process in which the collector evaluate an expression during collection and record the result in the .metadata.json instead of the original expression.
    For example, the compiler couldn't refer selector reference because it is not exported

    ```javascript
    let selector = 'app-root';
    @Component({
      selector: selector
    })
    ```
    Will be folded into inline selector

    ```javascript
    @Component({
          selector: 'app-root'
        })
    ```
    Remember that the compiler can’t fold everything. For example, spread operator on arrays, objects created using new keywords and function calls.

  **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

88. ### What are macros?
    The AOT compiler supports macros in the form of functions or static methods that return an expression in a `single return expression`.
    For example, let us take a below macro function,

    ```javascript
    export function wrapInArray<T>(value: T): T[] {
      return [value];
    }
    ```

    You can use it inside metadata as an expression,

    ```javascript
    @NgModule({
      declarations: wrapInArray(TypicalComponent)
    })
    export class TypicalModule {}
    ```

    The compiler treats the macro expression as it written directly

    ```javascript
    @NgModule({
      declarations: [TypicalComponent]
    })
    export class TypicalModule {}
    ```

  **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

89. ### Give an example of few metadata errors?
    Below are some of the errors encountered in metadata,

    1. **Expression form not supported:** Some of the language features outside of the compiler's restricted expression syntax used in angular metadata can produce this error.
        Let's see some of these examples,
        ```javascript
        1. export class User { ... }
           const prop = typeof User; // typeof is not valid in metadata
        2. { provide: 'token', useValue: { [prop]: 'value' } }; // bracket notation is not valid in metadata
        ```
    2. **Reference to a local (non-exported) symbol:** The compiler encountered a referenced to a locally defined symbol that either wasn't exported or wasn't initialized.
        Let's take example of this error,
        ```javascript
        // ERROR
        let username: string; // neither exported nor initialized

        @Component({
          selector: 'my-component',
          template: ... ,
          providers: [
            { provide: User, useValue: username }
          ]
        })
        export class MyComponent {}
        ```
        You can fix this by either exporting or initializing the value,
        ```javascript
        export let username: string; // exported
        (or)
        let username = 'John'; // initialized
        ```
     3. **Function calls are not supported:** The compiler does not currently support function expressions or lambda functions. For example, you cannot set a provider's useFactory to an anonymous function or arrow function as below.
        ```javascript
         providers: [
            { provide: MyStrategy, useFactory: function() { ... } },
            { provide: OtherStrategy, useFactory: () => { ... } }
          ]
        ```
        You can fix this with exported function
        ```javascript
        export function myStrategy() { ... }
        export function otherStrategy() { ... }
        ... // metadata
        providers: [
            { provide: MyStrategy, useFactory: myStrategy },
            { provide: OtherStrategy, useFactory: otherStrategy },
        ```
     4. **Destructured variable or constant not supported:** The compiler does not support references to variables assigned by destructuring.
        For example, you cannot write something like this:
        ```javascript
        import { user } from './user';

        // destructured assignment to name and age
        const {name, age} = user;
        ... //metadata
        providers: [
            {provide: Name, useValue: name},
            {provide: Age, useValue: age},
          ]
        ```
        You can fix this by non-destructured values
        ```javscript
        import { user } from './user';
        ... //metadata
        providers: [
            {provide: Name, useValue: user.name},
            {provide: Age, useValue: user.age},
          ]
        ```

90. ### What is metadata rewriting?
    Metadata rewriting is the process in which the compiler converts the expression initializing the fields such as useClass, useValue, useFactory, and data into an exported variable, which replaces the expression. Remember that the compiler does this rewriting during the emit of the .js file but not in definition files( .d.ts file).

91. ### How do you provide configuration inheritance?
    Angular Compiler supports configuration inheritance through extends in the tsconfig.json on angularCompilerOptions. i.e, The configuration from the base file(for example, tsconfig.base.json) are loaded first, then overridden by those in the inheriting config file.

    ```javascript
    {
      "extends": "../tsconfig.base.json",
      "compilerOptions": {
        "experimentalDecorators": true,
        ...
      },
      "angularCompilerOptions": {
        "fullTemplateTypeCheck": true,
        "preserveWhitespaces": true,
        ...
      }
    }
    ```

  **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

92. ### How do you specify angular template compiler options?
    The angular template compiler options are specified as members of the **angularCompilerOptions** object in the tsconfig.json file. These options will be specified adjecent to typescript compiler options.

    ```javascript
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "experimentalDecorators": true,
                  ...
      },
      "angularCompilerOptions": {
        "fullTemplateTypeCheck": true,
        "preserveWhitespaces": true,
                  ...
      }
    }
    ```

93. ### How do you enable binding expression validation?
    You can enable binding expression validation explicitly by adding the compiler option **fullTemplateTypeCheck** in the "angularCompilerOptions" of the project's tsconfig.json. It produces error messages when a type error is detected in a template binding expression.

    For example, consider the following component:
    ```javascript
    @Component({
      selector: 'my-component',
      template: '{{user.contacts.email}}'
    })
    class MyComponent {
      user?: User;
    }
    ```
    This will produce the following error:
    ```javascript
    my.component.ts.MyComponent.html(1,1): : Property 'contacts' does not exist on type 'User'. Did you mean 'contact'?
    ```

  **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

94. ### What is the purpose of any type cast function?
    You can disable binding expression type checking using $any() type cast function(by surrounding the expression). In the following example, the error Property contacts does not exist is suppressed by casting user to the any type.
    ```javascript
      template:
      '{{ $any(user).contacts.email }}'
    ```
    The $any() cast function also works with this to allow access to undeclared members of the component.
    ```javascript
       template:
       '{{ $any(this).contacts.email }}'
    ```

  **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

95. ### What is Non null type assertion operator?
    You can use the non-null type assertion operator to suppress the Object is possibly 'undefined' error. In the following example, the user and contact properties are always set together, implying that contact is always non-null if user is non-null. The error is suppressed in the example by using contact!.email.
    ```javascript
    @Component({
      selector: 'my-component',
      template: '<span *ngIf="user"> {{user.name}} contacted through {{contact!.email}} </span>'
    })
    class MyComponent {
      user?: User;
      contact?: Contact;

      setData(user: User, contact: Contact) {
        this.user = user;
        this.contact = contact;
      }
    }
    ```

  **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

96. ### What is type narrowing?
    The expression used in an ngIf directive is used to narrow type unions in the Angular template compiler similar to if expression in typescript. So *ngIf allows the typeScript compiler to infer that the data used in the binding expression will never be undefined.
    ```javascript
    @Component({
      selector: 'my-component',
      template: '<span *ngIf="user"> {{user.contact.email}} </span>'
    })
    class MyComponent {
      user?: User;
    }
    ```

97. ### How do you describe various dependencies in angular application?
    The dependencies section of package.json with in an angular application can be divided as follow,

    1. **Angular packages:** Angular core and optional modules; their package names begin @angular/.
    2. **Support packages:** Third-party libraries that must be present for Angular apps to run.
    3. **Polyfill packages:** Polyfills plug gaps in a browser's JavaScript implementation.

100. ### What is codelyzer?
     Codelyzer provides set of tslint rules for static code analysis of Angular TypeScript projects. You can run the static code analyzer over web apps, NativeScript, Ionic etc. Angular CLI has support for this and it can be use as below,
     ```bash
     ng new codelyzer
     ng lint
     ```

101. ### What is angular animation?
     Angular's animation system is built on CSS functionality in order to animate any property that the browser considers animatable. These properties includes positions, sizes, transforms, colors, borders etc. The Angular modules for animations are **@angular/animations** and **@angular/platform-browser** and these dependencies are automatically added to your project when you create a project using Angular CLI.

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

102. ### What are the steps to use animation module?
     You need to follow below steps to implement animation in your angular project,

     1. **Enabling the animations module:** Import BrowserAnimationsModule to add animation capabilities into your Angular root application module(for example, src/app/app.module.ts).
         ```javascript
         import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
         import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
         import { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';

         @NgModule({
           imports: [
             BrowserModule,
             BrowserAnimationsModule
           ],
           declarations: [ ],
           bootstrap: [ ]
         })
         export class AppModule { }
         ```
     2. **Importing animation functions into component files:** Import required animation functions from @angular/animations in component files(for example, src/app/app.component.ts).
         ```javascript
         import {
           trigger,
           state,
           style,
           animate,
           transition,
           // ...
         } from '@angular/animations';
         ```
     3. **Adding the animation metadata property:** add a metadata property called animations: within the @Component() decorator in component files(for example, src/app/app.component.ts)
         ```javascript
         @Component({
           selector: 'app-root',
           templateUrl: 'app.component.html',
           styleUrls: ['app.component.css'],
           animations: [
             // animation triggers go here
           ]
         })
         ```

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

103. ### What is State function?
     Angular's state() function is used to define different states to call at the end of each transition. This function takes two arguments: a unique name like open or closed and a style() function.

     For example, you can write a open state function

     ```javascript
     state('open', style({
       height: '300px',
       opacity: 0.5,
       backgroundColor: 'blue'
     })),
     ```

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

104. ### What is Style function?
     The style function is used to define a set of styles to associate with a given state name. You need to use it along with state() function to set CSS style attributes. For example, in the close state, the button has a height of 100 pixels, an opacity of 0.8, and a background color of green.

     ```javascript
     state('close', style({
       height: '100px',
       opacity: 0.8,
       backgroundColor: 'green'
     })),
     ```
     **Note:** The style attributes must be in camelCase.

105. ### What is the purpose of animate function?
     Angular Animations are a powerful way to implement sophisticated and compelling animations for your Angular single page web application.

        ```javascript
        import { Component, OnInit, Input } from '@angular/core';
        import { trigger, state, style, animate, transition } from '@angular/animations';
    
        @Component({
        selector: 'app-animate',
        templateUrl: `<div [@changeState]="currentState" class="myblock mx-auto"></div>`,
        styleUrls: `.myblock {
            background-color: green;
            width: 300px;
            height: 250px;
            border-radius: 5px;
            margin: 5rem;
            }`,
        animations: [
            trigger('changeState', [
            state('state1', style({
                backgroundColor: 'green',
                transform: 'scale(1)'
            })),
            state('state2', style({
                backgroundColor: 'red',
                transform: 'scale(1.5)'
            })),
            transition('*=>state1', animate('300ms')),
            transition('*=>state2', animate('2000ms'))
            ])
        ]
        })
        export class AnimateComponent implements OnInit {
    
            @Input() currentState;
    
            constructor() { }
    
            ngOnInit() {
            }
        }
        ```

106. ### What is transition function?
     The animation transition function is used to specify the changes that occur between one state and another over a period of time. It accepts two arguments: the first argument accepts an expression that defines the direction between two transition states, and the second argument accepts an animate() function.

     Let's take an example state transition from open to closed with an half second transition between states.

     ```javascript
     transition('open => closed', [
       animate('500ms')
     ]),
     ```

107. ### How to inject the dynamic script in angular?
     Using DomSanitizer we can inject the dynamic Html,Style,Script,Url.

     ```
     import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
     import { DomSanitizer } from '@angular/platform-browser';
     @Component({
        selector: 'my-app',
        template: `
            <div [innerHtml]="htmlSnippet"></div>
        `,
     })
     export class App {
            constructor(protected sanitizer: DomSanitizer) {}
            htmlSnippet: string = this.sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustScript("<script>safeCode()</script>");
        }
     ```

 110. ### What are the differences between AngularJS and Angular with respect to dependency injection?
      Dependency injection is a common component in both AngularJS and Angular, but there are some key differences between the two frameworks in how it actually works.

        | AngularJS | Angular |
        |---- | ---------
        | Dependency injection tokens are always strings  | Tokens can have different types. They are often classes and sometimes can be strings. |
        | There is exactly one injector even though it is a multi-module applications | There is a tree hierarchy of injectors, with a root injector and an additional injector for each component. |

 111. ### What is Angular Ivy?
      Angular Ivy is a new rendering engine for Angular. You can choose to opt in a preview version of Ivy from Angular version 8.

      1. You can enable ivy in a new project by using the --enable-ivy flag with the ng new command

          ```bash
          ng new ivy-demo-app --enable-ivy
          ```
      2. You can add it to an existing project by adding `enableIvy` option in the `angularCompilerOptions` in your project's `tsconfig.app.json`.

          ```javascript
          {
            "compilerOptions": { ... },
            "angularCompilerOptions": {
              "enableIvy": true
            }
          }
          ```

 112. ### What are the features included in ivy preview?
      You can expect below features with Ivy preview,

      1. Generated code that is easier to read and debug at runtime
      2. Faster re-build time
      3. Improved payload size
      4. Improved template type checking

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

 113. ### Can I use AOT compilation with Ivy?
      Yes, it is a recommended configuration. Also, AOT compilation with Ivy is faster. So you need set the default build options(with in angular.json) for your project to always use AOT compilation.

      ```javascript
      {
        "projects": {
          "my-project": {
            "architect": {
              "build": {
                "options": {
                  ...
                  "aot": true,
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
      ```

 114. ### What is Angular Language Service?
      The Angular Language Service is a way to get completions, errors, hints, and navigation inside your Angular templates whether they are external in an HTML file or embedded in annotations/decorators in a string. It has the ability to autodetect that you are opening an Angular file, reads your `tsconfig.json` file, finds all the templates you have in your application, and then provides all the language services.

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

 115. ### How do you install angular language service in the project?
      You can install Angular Language Service in your project with the following npm command,

      ```javascript
      npm install --save-dev @angular/language-service
      ```
      After that add the following to the "compilerOptions" section of your project's tsconfig.json

      ```javascript
      "plugins": [
          {"name": "@angular/language-service"}
      ]
      ```
      **Note:** The completion and diagnostic services works for .ts files only. You need to use custom plugins for supporting HTML files.

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

 116. ### Is there any editor support for Angular Language Service?
      Yes, Angular Language Service is currently available for Visual Studio Code and WebStorm IDEs. You need to install angular language service using an extension and devDependency respectively. In sublime editor, you need to install typescript which has has a language service plugin model.

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

 117. ### Explain the features provided by Angular Language Service?
      Basically there are 3 main features provided by Angular Language Service,

      1. **Autocompletion:** Autocompletion can speed up your development time by providing you with contextual possibilities and hints as you type with in an interpolation and elements.

           ![ScreenShot](images/language-completion.gif)

      2. **Error checking:** It can also warn you of mistakes in your code.

           ![ScreenShot](images/language-error.gif)

      3. **Navigation:** Navigation allows you to hover a component, directive, module and then click and press F12 to go directly to its definition.

 120. ### What is Angular CLI Builder?
      In Angular8, the CLI Builder API is stable and available to developers who want to customize the `Angular CLI` by adding or modifying commands. For example, you could supply a builder to perform an entirely new task, or to change which third-party tool is used by an existing command.

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

 121. ### What is a builder?
      A builder function is a function that uses the `Architect API` to perform a complex process such as "build" or "test". The builder code is defined in an npm package. For example, BrowserBuilder runs a webpack build for a browser target and KarmaBuilder starts the Karma server and runs a webpack build for unit tests.

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

 122. ### How do you invoke a builder?
      The Angular CLI command `ng run` is used to invoke a builder with a specific target configuration. The workspace configuration file, `angular.json`, contains default configurations for built-in builders.

 123. ### How do you create app shell in Angular?
      An App shell is a way to render a portion of your application via a route at build time. This is useful to first paint of your application that appears quickly because the browser can render static HTML and CSS without the need to initialize JavaScript. You can achieve this using Angular CLI which generates an app shell for running server-side of your app.

      ```javascript
      ng generate appShell [options] (or)
      ng g appShell [options]
      ```

 124. ### What are the case types in Angular?
      Angular uses capitalization conventions to distinguish the names of various types. Angular follows the list of the below case types.

      1. **camelCase :** Symbols, properties, methods, pipe names, non-component directive selectors, constants uses lowercase on the first letter of the item. For example, "selectedUser"
      2. **UpperCamelCase (or PascalCase):** Class names, including classes that define components, interfaces, NgModules, directives, and pipes uses uppercase on the first letter of the item.
      3. **dash-case (or "kebab-case"):** The descriptive part of file names, component selectors uses dashes between the words. For example, "app-user-list".
      4. **UPPER_UNDERSCORE_CASE:** All constants uses capital letters connected with underscores. For example, "NUMBER_OF_USERS".

 129. ### What is a DI token?
      A DI token is a lookup token associated with a dependency provider in dependency injection system. The injector maintains an internal token-provider map that it references when asked for a dependency and the DI token is the key to the map. Let's take example of DI Token usage,

      ```javascript
      const BASE_URL = new InjectionToken<string>('BaseUrl');
      const injector =
         Injector.create({providers: [{provide: BASE_URL, useValue: 'http://some-domain.com'}]});
      const url = injector.get(BASE_URL);
      ```

 130. ### What is Angular DSL?
      A domain-specific language (DSL) is a computer language specialized to a particular application domain. Angular has its own Domain Specific Language (DSL) which allows us to write Angular specific html-like syntax on top of normal html. It has its own compiler that compiles this syntax to html that the browser can understand. This DSL is defined in NgModules such as animations, forms, and routing and navigation.

      Basically you will see 3 main syntax in Angular DSL.

      1. `()`: Used for Output and DOM events.
      2. `[]`: Used for Input and specific DOM element attributes.
      3. `*`: Structural directives(*ngFor or *ngIf) will affect/change the DOM structure.

132.  ### What is Bazel tool?
      Bazel is a powerful build tool developed and massively used by Google and it can keep track of the dependencies between different packages and build targets. In Angular8, you can build your CLI application with Bazel.
      **Note:** The Angular framework itself is built with Bazel.

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

133.  ### What are the advantages of Bazel tool?
      Below are the list of key advantages of Bazel tool,

      1. It creates the possibility of building your back-ends and front-ends with the same tool
      2. The incremental build and tests
      3. It creates the possibility to have remote builds and cache on a build farm.

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

134. ### How do you use Bazel with Angular CLI?
     The @angular/bazel package provides a builder that allows Angular CLI to use Bazel as the build tool.
     1. **Use in an existing applciation:** Add @angular/bazel using CLI
         ```javascript
         ng add @angular/bazel
         ```
     2. **Use in a new application:** Install the package and create the application with collection option
         ```javascript
         npm install -g @angular/bazel
         ng new --collection=@angular/bazel
         ```
     When you use ng build and ng serve commands, Bazel is used behind the scenes and outputs the results in dist/bin folder.

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

135. ### How do you run Bazel directly?
     Sometimes you may want to bypass the Angular CLI builder and run Bazel directly using Bazel CLI. You can install it globally using @bazel/bazel npm package. i.e, Bazel CLI is available under @bazel/bazel package. After you can apply the below common commands,

     ```javascrippt
     bazel build [targets] // Compile the default output artifacts of the given targets.
     bazel test [targets] // Run the tests with *_test targets found in the pattern.
     bazel run [target]: Compile the program represented by target and then run it.
     ```

136. ### What is platform in Angular?
     A platform is the context in which an Angular application runs. The most common platform for Angular applications is a web browser, but it can also be an operating system for a mobile device, or a web server. The runtime-platform is provided by the @angular/platform-* packages and these packages allow applications that make use of `@angular/core` and `@angular/common` to execute in different environments.
     i.e, Angular can be used as platform-independent framework in different environments, For example,

     1. While running in the browser, it uses `platform-browser` package.
     2. When SSR(server-side rendering ) is used, it uses `platform-server` package for providing web server implementation.

141. ### What is the purpose of differential loading in CLI?
     From Angular8 release onwards, the applications are built using differential loading strategy from CLI to build two separate bundles as part of your deployed application.

     1. The first build contains ES2015 syntax which takes the advantage of built-in support in modern browsers, ships less polyfills, and results in a smaller bundle size.
     2. The second build contains old ES5 syntax to support older browsers with all necessary polyfills. But this results in a larger bundle size.

     **Note:** This strategy is used to support multiple browsers but it only load the code that the browser needs.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

142. ### Is Angular supports dynamic imports?
     Yes, Angular 8 supports dynamic imports in router configuration. i.e, You can use the import statement for lazy loading the module using `loadChildren` method and it will be understood by the IDEs(VSCode and WebStorm), webpack, etc.
     Previously, you have been written as below to lazily load the feature module. By mistake, if you have typo in the module name it still accepts the string and throws an error during build time.
     ```javascript
     {path: ‘user’, loadChildren: ‘./users/user.module#UserModulee’},
     ```
     This problem is resolved by using dynamic imports and IDEs are able to find it during compile time itself.

144. ### What are workspace APIs?
     Angular 8.0 release introduces Workspace APIs to make it easier for developers to read and modify the angular.json file instead of manually modifying it. Currently, the only supported storage3 format is the JSON-based format used by the Angular CLI. You can enable or add optimization option for build target as below,
     ```javascript
     import { NodeJsSyncHost } from '@angular-devkit/core/node';
     import { workspaces } from '@angular-devkit/core';

     async function addBuildTargetOption() {
         const host = workspaces.createWorkspaceHost(new NodeJsSyncHost());
         const workspace = await workspaces.readWorkspace('path/to/workspace/directory/', host);

         const project = workspace.projects.get('my-app');
         if (!project) {
           throw new Error('my-app does not exist');
         }

         const buildTarget = project.targets.get('build');
         if (!buildTarget) {
           throw new Error('build target does not exist');
         }

         buildTarget.options.optimization = true;

         await workspaces.writeWorkspace(workspace, host);
     }

     addBuildTargetOption();
     ```

156. ### How do you find angular CLI version?
     Angular CLI provides it's installed version using below different ways using ng command,

     ```bash
     ng v
     ng version
     ng -v
     ng --version
     ```
     and the output would be as below,

     ```bash
     Angular CLI: 1.6.3
     Node: 8.11.3
     OS: darwin x64
     Angular:

159. ### What is rule in Schematics?

     In schematics world, it's a function that operates on a file tree to create, delete, or modify files in a specific manner.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

160. ### What is Schematics CLI?
     Schematics come with their own command-line tool known as Schematics CLI. It is used to install the schematics executable, which you can use to create a new schematics collection with an initial named schematic. The collection folder is a workspace for schematics. You can also use the schematics command to add a new schematic to an existing collection, or extend an existing schematic. You can install Schematic CLI globally as below,
     ```bash
     npm install -g @angular-devkit/schematics-cli
     ```

161. ### What are the best practices for security in angular?
     Below are the best practices of security in angular,

     1. Use the latest Angular library releases
     2. Don't modify your copy of Angular
     3. Avoid Angular APIs marked in the documentation as “Security Risk.”

165. ### What is Sanitization? Is angular supports it?
     **Sanitization** is the inspection of an untrusted value, turning it into a value that's safe to insert into the DOM. Yes, Angular suppports sanitization. It sanitizes untrusted values for HTML, styles, and URLs but sanitizing resource URLs isn't possible because they contain arbitrary code.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**



167. ### What is the difference between interpolated content and innerHTML?
     The main difference between interpolated and innerHTML code is the behavior of code interpreted. Interpolated content is always escaped i.e,  HTML isn't interpreted and the browser displays angle brackets in the element's text content. Where as in innerHTML binding, the content is interpreted i.e, the browser will convert < and > characters as HTMLEntities. For example, the usage in template would be as below,

     ```html
     <p>Interpolated value:</p>
     <div >{{htmlSnippet}}</div>
     <p>Binding of innerHTML:</p>
     <div [innerHTML]="htmlSnippet"></div>
     ```
     and the property defined in a component.

     ```javascript
     export class InnerHtmlBindingComponent {
       htmlSnippet = 'Template <script>alert("XSS Attack")</script> <b>Code attached</b>';
     }
     ```
     Even though innerHTML binding create a chance of XSS attack, Angular recognizes the value as unsafe and automatically sanitizes it.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

168. ### How do you prevent automatic sanitization?
     Sometimes the applications genuinely need to include executable code such as displaying `<iframe>` from an URL. In this case, you need to prevent automatic sanitization in Angular by saying that you inspected a value, checked how it was generated, and made sure it will always be secure. Basically it involves 2 steps,

     1. Inject DomSanitizer: You can inject DomSanitizer in component as parameter in constructor
     2. Mark the trusted value by calling some of the below methods

         1. bypassSecurityTrustHtml
         2. bypassSecurityTrustScript
         3. bypassSecurityTrustStyle
         4. bypassSecurityTrustUrl
         5. bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl

     For example,The  usage of dangerous url to trusted url would be as below,

     ```javascript
     constructor(private sanitizer: DomSanitizer) {
       this.dangerousUrl = 'javascript:alert("XSS attack")';
       this.trustedUrl = sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustUrl(this.dangerousUrl);
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

169. ### Is safe to use direct DOM API methods in terms of security?
     No,the built-in browser DOM APIs or methods don't automatically protect you from security vulnerabilities. In this case it is recommended to use Angular templates instead of directly interacting with DOM. If it is unavoidable then use the built-in Angular sanitization functions.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

170. ### What is DOM sanitizer?
     `DomSanitizer` is used to help preventing Cross Site Scripting Security bugs (XSS) by sanitizing values to be safe to use in the different DOM contexts.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

171. ### How do you support server side XSS protection in Angular application?
     The server-side XSS protection is supported in an angular application by using a templating language that automatically escapes values to prevent XSS vulnerabilities on the server. But don't use a templating language to generate Angular templates on the server side which creates a high risk of introducing template-injection vulnerabilities.

177. ### How does Angular simplifies Internationalization?

     Angular simplifies the below areas of internationalization,
     1. Displaying dates, number, percentages, and currencies in a local format.
     2. Preparing text in component templates for translation.
     3. Handling plural forms of words.
     4. Handling alternative text.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

178. ### How do you manually register locale data?
     By default, Angular only contains locale data for en-US which is English as spoken in the United States of America . But if you want to set to another locale, you must import locale data for that new locale. After that you can register using `registerLocaleData` method and the syntax of this method looks like below,
     ```javascript
     registerLocaleData(data: any, localeId?: any, extraData?: any): void
     ```
     For example, let us import German locale and register it in the application
     ```javascript
     import { registerLocaleData } from '@angular/common';
     import localeDe from '@angular/common/locales/de';

     registerLocaleData(localeDe, 'de');
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

179. ### What are the four phases of template translation?
     The i18n template translation process has four phases:

     1. **Mark static text messages in your component templates for translation:** You can place i18n on every element tag whose fixed text is to be translated. For example, you need i18n attribue for heading as below,
         ```javascript
         <h1 i18n>Hello i18n!</h1>
         ```

     2. **Create a translation file:** Use the Angular CLI xi18n command to extract the marked text into an industry-standard translation source file. i.e, Open terminal window at the root of the app project and run the CLI command xi18n.
         ```bash
         ng xi18n
         ```
        The above command creates a file named `messages.xlf` in your project's root directory.

        **Note:** You can supply command options to change the format, the name, the location, and the source locale of the extracted file.

     3. **Edit the generated translation file:** Translate the extracted text into the target language. In this step, create a localization folder (such as `locale`)under root directory(src) and then create target language translation file by copying and renaming the default messages.xlf file. You need to copy source text node and provide the translation under target tag.
         For example, create the translation file(messages.de.xlf) for German language
         ```javascript
         <trans-unit id="greetingHeader" datatype="html">
           <source>Hello i18n!</source>
           <target>Hallo i18n !</target>
           <note priority="1" from="description">A welcome header for this sample</note>
           <note priority="1" from="meaning">welcome message</note>
         </trans-unit>
         ```

     4. **Merge the completed translation file into the app:** You need to use Angular CLI build command to compile the app, choosing a locale-specific configuration, or specifying the following command options.

           1. --i18nFile=path to the translation file
           2. --i18nFormat=format of the translation file
           3. --i18nLocale= locale id

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

180. ### What is the purpose of i18n attribute?
     The Angular i18n attribute marks translatable content. It is a custom attribute, recognized by Angular tools and compilers. The compiler removes it after translation.

     **Note:** Remember that i18n is not an Angular directive.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

181. ### What is the purpose of custom id?
     When you change the translatable text, the Angular extractor tool generates a new id for that translation unit. Because of this behavior, you must then update the translation file with the new id every time.

     For example, the translation file `messages.de.xlf.html` has generated trans-unit for some text message as below
     ```html
     <trans-unit id="827wwe104d3d69bf669f823jjde888" datatype="html">
     ```
     You can avoid this manual update of `id` attribute by specifying a custom id in the i18n attribute by using the prefix @@.
     ```javascript
     <h1 i18n="@@welcomeHeader">Hello i18n!</h1>
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

182. ### What happens if the custom id is not unique?
     You need to define custom ids as unique. If you use the same id for two different text messages then only the first one is extracted. But its translation is used in place of both original text messages.

     For example, let's define same custom id `myCustomId` for two messages,
     ```html
     <h2 i18n="@@myCustomId">Good morning</h3>
     <!-- ... -->
     <h2 i18n="@@myCustomId">Good night</p>
     ```
     and the translation unit generated for first text in for German language as
     ```html
     <trans-unit id="myId" datatype="html">
       <source>Good morning</source>
       <target state="new">Guten Morgen</target>
     </trans-unit>
     ```
     Since custom id is the same, both of the elements in the translation contain the same text as below
     ```html
     <h2>Guten Morgen</h2>
     <h2>Guten Morgen</h2>
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

183. ### Can I translate text without creating an element?
     Yes, you can achieve using `<ng-container>` attribute. Normally you need to wrap a text content with i18n attribute for the translation. But if you don't want to create a new DOM element just for the sake of translation, you can wrap the text in an <ng-container> element.
     ```html
     <ng-container i18n>I'm not using any DOM element for translation</ng-container>
     ```
     Remember that `<ng-container>` is transformed into an html comment

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

184. ### How can I translate attribute?
     You can translate attributes by attaching `i18n-x` attribute  where x is the name of the attribute to translate. For example, you can translate image title attribute as below,
     ```html
     <img [src]="example" i18n-title title="Internationlization" />
     ```
     By the way, you can also assign meaning, description and id with the i18n-x="<meaning>|<description>@@<id>" syntax.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

185. ### List down the pluralization categories?
     Pluralization has below categories depending on the language.
     1. =0 (or any other number)
     2. zero
     3. one
     4. two
     5. few
     6. many
     7. other

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

186. ### What is select ICU expression?
     ICU expression is is similar to the plural expressions except that you choose among alternative translations based on a string value instead of a number. Here you define those string values.

     Let's take component binding with `residenceStatus` property which has "citizen", "permanent resident" and "foreigner" possible values and the message maps those values to the appropriate translations.
     ```javascript
     <span i18n>The person is {residenceStatus, select, citizen {citizen} permanent resident {permanentResident} foreigner {foreigner}}</span>
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

187. ### How do you report missing translations?
     By default, When translation is missing, it generates a warning message such as "Missing translation for message 'somekey'". But you can configure with a different level of message in Angular compiler as below,
     1. **Error:** It throws an error. If you are using AOT compilation, the build will fail. But if you are using JIT compilation, the app will fail to load.
     2. **Warning (default):** It shows a 'Missing translation' warning in the console or shell.
     3. **Ignore:** It doesn't do anything.

     If you use AOT compiler then you need to perform changes in `configurations` section of your Angular CLI configuration file, angular.json.
     ```javascript
     "configurations": {
       ...
       "de": {
         ...
         "i18nMissingTranslation": "error"
       }
     }
     ```
     If you use the JIT compiler, specify the warning level in the compiler config at bootstrap by adding the 'MissingTranslationStrategy' property as below,
     ```javascript
     import { MissingTranslationStrategy } from '@angular/core';
     import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';
     import { AppModule } from './app/app.module';

     platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule, {
       missingTranslation: MissingTranslationStrategy.Error,
       providers: [
         // ...
       ]
     });
     ```
     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
188. ### How do you provide build configuration for multiple locales?
     You can provide build configuration such as translation file path, name, format and application url in `configuration` settings of Angular.json file. For example, the German version of your application configured the build as follows,
     ```javascript
     "configurations": {
       "de": {
         "aot": true,
         "outputPath": "dist/my-project-de/",
         "baseHref": "/fr/",
         "i18nFile": "src/locale/messages.de.xlf",
         "i18nFormat": "xlf",
         "i18nLocale": "de",
         "i18nMissingTranslation": "error",
       }
     ```

189. ### What is an angular library?
     An Angular library is an Angular project that differs from an app in that it cannot run on its own. It must be imported and used in an app. For example,  you can import or add `service worker` library to an Angular application which turns an application into a Progressive Web App (PWA).

     **Note:** You can create own third party library and publish it as npm package to be used in an Application.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**


191. ### How do you select an element in component template?
     You can control any DOM element via ElementRef by injecting it into your component's constructor. i.e, The component should have constructor with ElementRef parameter,
     ```javascript
     constructor(myElement: ElementRef) {
        el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = 'yellow';
     }
     ```

193. ### What is protractor?
     Protractor is an end-to-end test framework for Angular and AngularJS applications. It runs tests against your application running in a real browser, interacting with it as a user would.
     ```javascript
     npm install -g protractor
     ```

194. ### What is collection?
     Collection is a set of related schematics collected in an npm package. For example, `@schematics/angular` collection is used in Angular CLI to apply transforms to a web-app project. You can create your own schematic collection for customizing angular projects.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

195. ### How do you create schematics for libraries?
     You can create your own schematic collections to integrate your library with the Angular CLI. These collections are classified as 3 main schematics,
     1. **Add schematics:** These schematics are used to install library in an Angular workspace using `ng add` command.
        For example, @angular/material schematic tells the add command to install and set up Angular Material and theming.
     2. **Generate schematics**: These schematics are used to modify projects, add configurations and scripts, and scaffold artifacts in library using `ng generate` command.
        For example, @angular/material generation schematic supplies generation schematics for the UI components. Let's say the table component is generated using `ng generate @angular/material:table `.
     3. **Update schematics:** These schematics are used to update library's dependencies and adjust for breaking changes in a new library release using `ng update` command.
        For example, @angular/material update schematic updates material and cdk dependencies using `ng update @angular/material` command.

196. ### How do you use jquery in Angular?
     You can use jquery in Angular using 3 simple steps,
     1. **Install the dependency:** At first, install the jquery dependency using npm
         ```cmd
            npm install --save jquery
         ```
     2. **Add the jquery script:** In Angular-CLI project, add the relative path to jquery in the angular.json file.
         ```javascript
         "scripts": [
            "node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"
         ]
         ```
     3. **Start using jquery:** Define the element in template. Whereas declare the jquery variable and apply CSS classes on the element.
         ```html
         <div id="elementId">
           <h1>JQuery integration</h1>
         </div>
         ```
         ```javascript
         import {Component, OnInit} from '@angular/core';

         declare var $: any; // (or) import * as $ from 'jquery';

         @Component({
           selector: 'app-root',
           templateUrl: './app.component.html',
           styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
         })
         export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
           ngOnInit(): void {
             $(document).ready(() => {
               $('#elementId').css({'text-color': 'blue', 'font-size': '150%'});
             });
           }
         }
         ```

197. ### What is the reason for No provider for HTTP exception?
     This exception is due to missing HttpClientModule in your module. You just need to import in module as below,
     ```javascript
     import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';

     @NgModule({
       imports: [
         BrowserModule,
         HttpClientModule,
       ],
       declarations: [ AppComponent ],
       bootstrap:    [ AppComponent ]
     })
     export class AppModule { }
     ```

198. ### What is router state?
     The RouteState is an interface which represents the state of the router as a tree of activated routes.
     ```javascript
     interface RouterState extends Tree {
       snapshot: RouterStateSnapshot
       toString(): string
     }
     ```
     You can access the current RouterState from anywhere in the Angular app using the Router service and the routerState property.

199. ### How can I use SASS in angular project?
     When you are creating your project with angular cli, you can use `ng new`command. It generates all your components with predefined sass files.
     ```javascript
     ng new My_New_Project --style=sass
     ```
     But if you are changing your existing style in your project then use `ng set` command,
     ```javascript
     ng set defaults.styleExt scss
     ```

202. ### What is slice pipe?
     The slice pipe is used to create a new Array or String containing a subset (slice) of the elements. The syntax looks like as below,
     ```javascript
     {{ value_expression | slice : start [ : end ] }}
     ```
     For example, you can provide 'hello' list based on a greeting array,
     ```javascript
     @Component({
       selector: 'list-pipe',
       template: `<ul>
         <li *ngFor="let i of greeting | slice:0:5">{{i}}</li>
       </ul>`
     })
     export class PipeListComponent {
       greeting: string[] = ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', 'm','o', 'r', 'n', 'i', 'n', 'g'];
     }
     ```

203. ### What is index property in ngFor directive?
     The index property of the NgFor directive is used to return the zero-based index of the item in each iteration. You can capture the index in a template input variable and use it in the template.

     For example, you can capture the index in a variable named indexVar and displays it with the todo's name using ngFor directive as below.
     ```javascript
     <div *ngFor="let todo of todos; let i=index">{{i + 1}} - {{todo.name}}</div>
     ```

204. ### What is the purpose of ngFor trackBy?
     The main purpose of using *ngFor with trackBy option is performance optimization. Normally if you use NgFor with large data sets, a small change to one item by removing or adding an item, can trigger a cascade of DOM manipulations. In this case, Angular sees only a fresh list of new object references and to replace the old DOM elements with all new DOM elements. You can help Angular to track which items added or removed by providing a `trackBy` function which takes the index and the current item as arguments and needs to return the unique identifier for this item.

     For example, lets set trackBy to the trackByTodos() method
     ```javascript
     <div *ngFor="let todo of todos; trackBy: trackByTodos">
       ({{todo.id}}) {{todo.name}}
     </div>
     ```
     and define the trackByTodos method,
     ```javascript
     trackByTodos(index: number, item: Todo): number { return todo.id; }
     ```

205. ### What is the purpose of ngSwitch directive?
     **NgSwitch** directive is similar to JavaScript switch statement which displays one element from among several possible elements, based on a switch condition. In this case only the selected element placed into the DOM. It has been used along with `NgSwitch`, `NgSwitchCase` and `NgSwitchDefault` directives.

     For example, let's display the browser details based on selected browser using ngSwitch directive.
     ```javascript
     <div [ngSwitch]="currentBrowser.name">
       <chrome-browser    *ngSwitchCase="'chrome'"    [item]="currentBrowser"></chrome-browser>
       <firefox-browser   *ngSwitchCase="'firefox'"     [item]="currentBrowser"></firefox-browser>
       <opera-browser     *ngSwitchCase="'opera'"  [item]="currentBrowser"></opera-browser>
       <safari-browser     *ngSwitchCase="'safari'"   [item]="currentBrowser"></safari-browser>
       <ie-browser  *ngSwitchDefault           [item]="currentItem"></ie-browser>
     </div>
     ```

206. ### Is it possible to do aliasing for inputs and outputs?
     Yes, it is possible to do aliasing for inputs and outputs in two ways.
     1. **Aliasing in metadata:** The inputs and outputs in the metadata aliased using a colon-delimited (:) string with the directive property name on the left and the public alias on the right. i.e. It will be in the format of propertyName:alias.
         ```javascript
         inputs: ['input1: buyItem'],
         outputs: ['outputEvent1: completedEvent']
         ```
     2. **Aliasing with @Input()/@Output() decorator:** The alias can be specified for the property name by passing the alias name to the @Input()/@Output() decorator.i.e. It will be in the form of @Input(alias) or @Output(alias).
         ```javascript
         @Input('buyItem') input1: string;
         @Output('completedEvent') outputEvent1 = new EventEmitter<string>();
         ```

207. ### What is safe navigation operator?
     The safe navigation operator(?)(or known as Elvis Operator) is used to guard against `null` and `undefined` values in property paths when you are not aware whether a path exists or not. i.e. It returns value of the object path if it exists, else it returns the null value.

     For example, you can access nested properties of a user profile easily without null reference errors as below,
     ```javascript
     <p>The user firstName is: {{user?.fullName.firstName}}</p>
     ```
     Using this safe navigation operator, Angular framework stops evaluating the expression when it hits the first null value and renders the view without any errors.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

208. ### Is any special configuration required for Angular9?
     You don't need any special configuration. In Angular9, the Ivy renderer is the default Angular compiler. Even though Ivy is available Angular8 itself, you had to configure it in tsconfig.json file as below,
     ```javascript
     "angularCompilerOptions": {    "enableIvy": true  }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

209. ### What are type safe TestBed API changes in Angular9?
     Angular 9 provides type safe changes in TestBed API changes by replacing the old get function with the new inject method. Because TestBed.get method is not type-safe. The usage would be as below,
     ```javascript
     TestBed.get(ChangeDetectorRef) // returns any. It is deprecated now.

     TestBed.inject(ChangeDetectorRef) // returns ChangeDetectorRef
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

210. ### Is mandatory to pass static flag for ViewChild?
     In Angular 8, the static flag is required for ViewChild. Whereas in Angular9, you no longer need to pass this property. Once you updated to Angular9 using `ng update`, the migration will remove { static: false } script everywhere.
     ```javascript
     @ViewChild(ChildDirective) child: ChildDirective; // Angular9 usage
     @ViewChild(ChildDirective, { static: false }) child: ChildDirective; //Angular8 usage
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

211. ### What are the list of template expression operators?
     The Angular template expression language supports three special template expression operators.
     1. Pipe operator
     2. Safe navigation operator
     3. Non-null assertion operator

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

212. ### What is the precedence between pipe and ternary operators?
     The pipe operator has a higher precedence than the ternary operator (?:). For example, the expression `first ? second : third | fourth` is parsed as `first ? second : (third | fourth)`.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

213. ### What is an entry component?
     An entry component is any component that Angular loads imperatively(i.e, not referencing it in the template) by type. Due to this behavior, they can’t be found by the Angular compiler during compilation. These components created dynamically with `ComponentFactoryResolver`.

     Basically, there are two main kinds of entry components which are following -
     1. The bootstrapped root component
     2. A component you specify in a route

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
214. ### What is a bootstrapped component?
     A bootstrapped component is an entry component that Angular loads into the DOM during the bootstrap process or application launch time. Generally, this bootstrapped or root component is named as `AppComponent` in your root module using `bootstrap` property as below.
     ```js
     @NgModule({
       declarations: [
         AppComponent
       ],
       imports: [
         BrowserModule,
         FormsModule,
         HttpClientModule,
         AppRoutingModule
       ],
       providers: [],
       bootstrap: [AppComponent] // bootstrapped entry component need to be declared here
     })
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
215. ### How do you manually bootstrap an application?
     You can use `ngDoBootstrap` hook for a manual bootstrapping of the application instead of using bootstrap array in `@NgModule` annotation. This hook is part of `DoBootstap` interface.
     ```js
     interface DoBootstrap {
       ngDoBootstrap(appRef: ApplicationRef): void
     }
     ```
     The module needs to be implement the above interface to use the hook for bootstrapping.
     ```js
     class AppModule implements DoBootstrap {
       ngDoBootstrap(appRef: ApplicationRef) {
         appRef.bootstrap(AppComponent); // bootstrapped entry component need to be passed
       }
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

216. ### Is it necessary for bootstrapped component to be entry component?
     Yes, the bootstrapped component needs to be an entry component. This is because the bootstrapping process is an imperative process.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

217. ### What is a routed entry component?
     The components referenced in router configuration are called as routed entry components. This routed entry component defined in a route definition as below,
     ```js
     const routes: Routes = [
       {
         path: '',
         component: TodoListComponent // router entry component
       }
     ];
     ```
     Since router definition requires you to add the component in two places (router and entryComponents), these components are always entry components.

     **Note:** The compilers are smart enough to recognize a router definition and automatically add the router component into `entryComponents`.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

218. ### Why is not necessary to use entryComponents array every time?
     Most of the time, you don't need to explicity to set entry components in entryComponents array of ngModule decorator. Because angular adds components from both @NgModule.bootstrap and route definitions to entry components automatically.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

219. ### Do I still need to use entryComponents array in Angular9?
     No. In previous angular releases, the entryComponents array of ngModule decorator is used to tell the compiler which components would be created and inserted dynamically in the view. In Angular9, this is not required anymore with Ivy.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

220. ### Is it all components generated in production build?
     No, only the entry components and template components appears in production builds. If a component isn't an entry component and isn't found in a template, the tree shaker will throw it away. Due to this reason, make sure to add only true entry components to reduce the bundle size.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

221. ### What is Angular compiler?
     The Angular compiler is used to convert the application code into JavaScript code. It reads the template markup, combines it with the corresponding component class code, and emits component factories which creates JavaScript representation of the component along with elements of @Component metadata.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

222. ### What is the role of ngModule metadata in compilation process?
     The `@NgModule` metadata is used to tell the Angular compiler what components to be compiled for this module and how to link this module with other modules.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

223. ### How does angular finds components, directives and pipes?
     The Angular compiler finds a component or directive in a template when it can match the selector of that component or directive in that template. Whereas it finds a pipe if the pipe's name appears within the pipe syntax of the template HTML.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

224. ### Give few examples for NgModules?
     The Angular core libraries and third-party libraries are available as NgModules.
     1. Angular libraries such as FormsModule, HttpClientModule, and RouterModule are NgModules.
     2. Many third-party libraries such as Material Design, Ionic, and AngularFire2 are NgModules.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

225. ### What are feature modules?
     Feature modules are NgModules, which are used for the purpose of organizing code. The feature module can be created with Angular CLI using the below command in the root directory,
     ```javascript
     ng generate module MyCustomFeature //
     ```
     Angular CLI creates a folder called `my-custom-feature` with a file inside called `my-custom-feature.module.ts` with the following contents
     ```javascript
     import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
     import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';

     @NgModule({
       imports: [
         CommonModule
       ],
       declarations: []
     })
     export class MyCustomFeature { }
     ```

     **Note:**  The "Module" suffix shouldn't present in the name because the CLI appends it.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

226. ### What are the imported modules in CLI generated feature modules?
     In the CLI generated feature module, there are two JavaScript import statements at the top of the file
     1. **NgModule:** InOrder to use the `@NgModule` decorator
     2. **CommonModule:** It provides many common directives such as `ngIf` and `ngFor`.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

227. ### What are the differences between ngmodule and javascript module?
     Below are the main differences between Angular NgModule and javascript module,

     | NgModule | JavaScript module |
     |---- | --------- |
     | NgModule bounds declarable classes only | There is no restriction classes |
     | List the module's classes in declarations array only | Can define all member classes in one giant file |
     | It only export the declarable classes it owns or imports from other modules| It can export any classes |
     | Extend the entire application with services by adding providers to provides array | Can't extend the application with services |

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

228. ### What are the possible errors with declarations?
     There are two common possible errors with declarations array,
     1. If you use a component without declaring it, Angular returns an error message.
     2. If you try to declare the same class in more than one module then compiler emits an error.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

229. ### What are the steps to use declaration elements?
     Below are the steps to be followed to use declaration elements.
     1. Create the element(component, directive and pipes) and export it from the file where you wrote it
     2. Import it into the appropriate module.
     3. Declare it in the @NgModule declarations array.


     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

230. ### What happens if browserModule used in feature module?
     If you do import `BrowserModule` into a lazy loaded feature module, Angular returns an error telling you to use `CommonModule` instead. Because BrowserModule’s providers are for the entire app so it should only be in the root module, not in feature module. Whereas Feature modules only need the common directives in CommonModule.

     ![ScreenShot](images/browser-module-error.gif)

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

231. ### What are the types of feature modules?
     Below are the five categories of feature modules,
     1. **Domain:** Deliver a user experience dedicated to a particular application domain(For example, place an order, registration etc)
     2. **Routed:** These are domain feature modules whose top components are the targets of router navigation routes.
     3. **Routing:** It provides routing configuration for another module.
     4. **Service:** It provides utility services such as data access and messaging(For example, HttpClientModule)
     5. **Widget:** It makes components, directives, and pipes available to external modules(For example, third-party libraries such as Material UI)

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

232. ### What is a provider?
     A provider is an instruction to the Dependency Injection system on how to obtain a value for a dependency(aka services created). The service can be provided using Angular CLI as below,
     ```javascript
     ng generate service my-service
     ```
     The created service by CLI would be as below,
     ```js
     import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

     @Injectable({
       providedIn: 'root', //Angular provide the service in root injector
     })
     export class MyService {
     }
     ```
     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

233. ### What is the recommendation for provider scope?
     You should always provide your service in the root injector unless there is a case where you want the service to be available only if you import a particular @NgModule.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

234. ### How do you restrict provider scope to a module?
     It is possible to restrict service provider scope to a specific module instead making available to entire application. There are two possible ways to do it.
     1. **Using providedIn in service:**
         ```js
         import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
         import { SomeModule } from './some.module';

         @Injectable({
           providedIn: SomeModule,
         })
         export class SomeService {
         }
         ```
     2. **Declare provider for the service in module:**
         ```js
         import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

         import { SomeService } from './some.service';

         @NgModule({
           providers: [SomeService],
         })
         export class SomeModule {
         }
         ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

235. ### How do you provide a singleton service?
     There are two possible ways to provide a singleton service.
     1. Set the providedIn property of the @Injectable() to "root". This is the preferred way(starting from Angular 6.0) of creating a singleton service since it makes your services tree-shakable.

         ```js
         import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

         @Injectable({
           providedIn: 'root',
         })
         export class MyService {
         }
         ```
     2. Include the service in root module or in a module that is only imported by root module. It has been used to register services before Angular 6.0.

         ```js
         @NgModule({
           ...
           providers: [MyService],
           ...
         })
         ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

236. ### What are the different ways to remove duplicate service registration?
     If a module defines provides and declarations then loading the module in multiple feature modules will duplicate the registration of the service. Below are the different ways to prevent this duplicate behavior.
     1. Use the providedIn syntax instead of registering the service in the module.
     2. Separate your services into their own module.
     3. Define forRoot() and forChild() methods in the module.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

237. ### How does forRoot method helpful to avoid duplicate router instances?
     If the `RouterModule` module didn’t have forRoot() static method then each feature module would instantiate a new Router instance, which leads to broken application due to duplicate instances. After using forRoot() method, the root application module imports `RouterModule.forRoot(...)` and gets a Router, and all feature modules import `RouterModule.forChild(...)` which does not instantiate another Router.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

238. ### What is a shared module?
     The Shared Module is the module in which you put commonly used directives, pipes, and components into one module that is shared(import it) throughout the application.

     For example, the below shared module imports CommonModule, FormsModule for common directives and components, pipes and directives based on the need,
     ```js
     import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
     import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
     import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
     import { UserComponent } from './user.component';
     import { NewUserDirective } from './new-user.directive';
     import { OrdersPipe } from './orders.pipe';

     @NgModule({
      imports:      [ CommonModule ],
      declarations: [ UserComponent, NewUserDirective, OrdersPipe ],
      exports:      [ UserComponent, NewUserDirective, OrdersPipe,
                      CommonModule, FormsModule ]
     })
     export class SharedModule { }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

239. ### Can I share services using modules?
     No, it is not recommended to share services by importing module. i.e Import modules when you want to use directives, pipes, and components only. The best approach to get a hold of shared services is through 'Angular dependency injection' because importing a module will result in a new service instance.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

240. ### How do you get current direction for locales?
     In Angular 9.1, the API method `getLocaleDirection` can be used to get the current direction in your app. This method is useful to support Right to Left locales for your Internationalization based applications.
     ```js
     import { getLocaleDirection, registerLocaleData } from '@angular/common';
     import { LOCALE_ID } from '@angular/core';
     import localeAr from '@angular/common/locales/ar';

       ...

       constructor(@Inject(LOCALE_ID) locale) {

         const directionForLocale = getLocaleDirection(locale); // Returns 'rtl' or 'ltr' based on the current locale
         registerLocaleData(localeAr, 'ar-ae');
         const direction = getLocaleDirection('ar-ae'); // Returns 'rtl'

         // Current direction is used to provide conditional logic here
       }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

241. ### What is ngcc?
     The ngcc(Angular Compatibility Compiler) is a tool which upgrades node_module compiled with non-ivy ngc into ivy compliant format. The `postinstall` script from package.json will make sure your node_modules will be compatible with the Ivy renderer.
     ```js
     "scripts": {
        "postinstall": "ngcc"
     }
     ```

     Whereas, Ivy compiler (ngtsc), which compiles Ivy-compatible code.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

242. ### What classes should not be added to declarations?
     The below class types shouldn't be added to declarations
     1. A class which is already declared in any another module.
     2. Directives imported from another module.
     3. Module classes.
     4. Service classes.
     5. Non-Angular classes and objects, such as strings, numbers, functions, entity models, configurations, business logic, and helper classes.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

243. ### What is NgZone?
     Angular provides a service called NgZone which creates a zone named `angular` to automatically trigger change detection when the following conditions are satisfied.
     1. When a sync or async function is executed.
     2. When there is no microTask scheduled.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

244. ### What is NoopZone?
     Zone is loaded/required by default in Angular applications and it helps Angular to know when to trigger the change detection. This way, it make sures developers focus on application development rather core part of Angular. You can also use Angular without Zone but the change detection need to be implemented on your own and `noop zone` need to be configured in bootstrap process.
     Let's follow the below two steps to remove zone.js,
     1. Remove the zone.js import from polyfills.ts.
         ```js
         /***************************************************************************************************
          * Zone JS is required by default for Angular itself.
          */
         // import 'zone.js/dist/zone';  // Included with Angular CLI.
         ```
     2. Bootstrap Angular with noop zone in src/main.ts.
         ```js
         platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule, {ngZone: 'noop'})
           .catch(err => console.error(err));
         ```

245. ### How do you create displayBlock components?
     By default, Angular CLI creates components in an inline displayed mode(i.e, display:inline). But it is possible to create components with display: block style using `displayBlock` option,
     ```js
     ng generate component my-component --displayBlock
     ```
     (OR) the option can be turned on by default in Angular.json with `schematics.@schematics/angular:component.displayBlock` key value as true.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

246. ### What are the possible data update scenarios for change detection?
     The change detection works in the following scenarios where the data changes needs to update the application HTML.
     1. **Component initialization:** While bootstrapping the Angular application, Angular triggers the `ApplicationRef.tick()` to call change detection and View Rendering.
     2. **Event listener:**  The DOM event listener can update the data in an Angular component and trigger the change detection too.
         ```js
         @Component({
           selector: 'app-event-listener',
           template: `
             <button (click)="onClick()">Click</button>
             {{message}}`
         })
         export class EventListenerComponent {
           message = '';

           onClick() {
             this.message = 'data updated';
           }
         }
         ```
     3. **HTTP Data Request:** You can get data from a server through an HTTP request
         ```js
         data = 'default value';
         constructor(private httpClient: HttpClient) {}

           ngOnInit() {
             this.httpClient.get(this.serverUrl).subscribe(response => {
               this.data = response.data; // change detection will happen automatically
             });
           }
         ```
     4. **Macro tasks setTimeout() or setInterval():** You can update the data in the callback function of setTimeout or setInterval
         ```js
         data = 'default value';

           ngOnInit() {
             setTimeout(() => {
               this.data = 'data updated'; // Change detection will happen automatically
             });
           }
         ```
     5. **Micro tasks Promises:** You can update the data in the callback function of promise
         ```js
         data = 'initial value';

           ngOnInit() {
             Promise.resolve(1).then(v => {
               this.data = v; // Change detection will happen automatically
             });
           }
         ```
     6. **Async operations like Web sockets and Canvas:** The data can be updated asynchronously using WebSocket.onmessage() and Canvas.toBlob().

247. ### What is a zone context?
      Execution Context is an abstract concept that holds information about the environment within the current code being executed. A zone provides an execution context that persists across asynchronous operations is called as zone context. For example, the zone context will be same in both outside and inside setTimeout callback function,
      ```js
      zone.run(() => {
        // outside zone
        expect(zoneThis).toBe(zone);
        setTimeout(function() {
          // the same outside zone exist here
          expect(zoneThis).toBe(zone);
        });
      });
      ```
      The current zone is retrieved through `Zone.current`.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

248. ### What are the lifecycle hooks of a zone?
     There are four lifecycle hooks for asynchronous operations from zone.js.
     1. **onScheduleTask:** This hook triggers when a new asynchronous task is scheduled. For example, when you call setTimeout()
         ```js
         onScheduleTask: function(delegate, curr, target, task) {
             console.log('new task is scheduled:', task.type, task.source);
             return delegate.scheduleTask(target, task);
           }
         ```
     2. **onInvokeTask:** This hook triggers when an asynchronous task is about to execute. For example, when the callback of setTimeout() is about to execute.
         ```js
         onInvokeTask: function(delegate, curr, target, task, applyThis, applyArgs) {
             console.log('task will be invoked:', task.type, task.source);
             return delegate.invokeTask(target, task, applyThis, applyArgs);
           }
         ```
     3. **onHasTask:** This hook triggers when the status of one kind of task inside a zone changes from stable(no tasks in the zone) to unstable(a new task is scheduled in the zone) or from unstable to stable.
         ```js
           onHasTask: function(delegate, curr, target, hasTaskState) {
             console.log('task state changed in the zone:', hasTaskState);
             return delegate.hasTask(target, hasTaskState);
           }
         ```
     4. **onInvoke:** This hook triggers when a synchronous function is going to execute in the zone.
         ```js
         onInvoke: function(delegate, curr, target, callback, applyThis, applyArgs) {
             console.log('the callback will be invoked:', callback);
             return delegate.invoke(target, callback, applyThis, applyArgs);
           }
         ```

249. ### What are the methods of NgZone used to control change detection?
     NgZone service provides a `run()` method that allows you to execute a function inside the angular zone. This function is used to execute third party APIs which are not handled by Zone and trigger change detection automatically at the correct time.
     ```js
     export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
       constructor(private ngZone: NgZone) {}
       ngOnInit() {
         // use ngZone.run() to make the asynchronous operation in the angular zone
         this.ngZone.run(() => {
           someNewAsyncAPI(() => {
             // update the data of the component
           });
         });
       }
     }
     ```
     Whereas `runOutsideAngular()` method is used when you don't want to trigger change detection.
     ```js
     export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
       constructor(private ngZone: NgZone) {}
       ngOnInit() {
         // Use this method when you know no data will be updated
         this.ngZone.runOutsideAngular(() => {
           setTimeout(() => {
             // update component data and don't trigger change detection
           });
         });
       }
     }
     ```
     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

250. ### How do you change the settings of zonejs?
     You can change the settings of zone by configuring them in a separate file and import it just after zonejs import.
     For example, you can disable the requestAnimationFrame() monkey patch to prevent change detection for no data update as one setting and prevent DOM events(a mousemove or scroll event) to trigger change detection. Let's say the new file named zone-flags.js,
     ```js
     // disable patching requestAnimationFrame
     (window as any).__Zone_disable_requestAnimationFrame = true;

     // disable patching specified eventNames
     (window as any).__zone_symbol__UNPATCHED_EVENTS = ['scroll', 'mousemove'];
     ```
     The above configuration file can be imported in a polyfill.ts file as below,
     ```js
     /***************************************************************************************************
      * Zone JS is required by default for Angular.
      */
     import `./zone-flags`;
     import 'zone.js/dist/zone';  // Included with Angular CLI.
     ```
     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

251. ### How do you trigger an animation?
     Angular provides a `trigger()` function for animation in order to collect the states and transitions with a specific animation name, so that you can attach it to the triggering element in the HTML template. This function watch for changes and trigger initiates the actions when a change occurs.
     For example, let's create trigger named `upDown`, and attach it to the button element.
     ```js
     content_copy
     @Component({
       selector: 'app-up-down',
       animations: [
         trigger('upDown', [
           state('up', style({
             height: '200px',
             opacity: 1,
             backgroundColor: 'yellow'
           })),
           state('down', style({
             height: '100px',
             opacity: 0.5,
             backgroundColor: 'green'
           })),
           transition('up => down', [
             animate('1s')
           ]),
           transition('down => up', [
             animate('0.5s')
           ]),
         ]),
       ],
       templateUrl: 'up-down.component.html',
       styleUrls: ['up-down.component.css']
     })
     export class UpDownComponent {
       isUp = true;

       toggle() {
         this.isUp = !this.isUp;
       }

     ```

252. ### How do you configure injectors with providers at different levels?
     You can configure injectors with providers at different levels of your application by setting a metadata value. The configuration can happen in one of three places,
     1. In the `@Injectable()` decorator for the service itself
     2. In the `@NgModule()` decorator for an NgModule
     3. In the `@Component()` decorator for a component

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

253. ### Is it mandatory to use injectable on every service class?
     No. The `@Injectable()` decorator is not strictly required if the class has other Angular decorators on it or does not have any dependencies. But the important thing here is any class that is going to be injected with Angular is decorated.
     i.e, If we add the decorator, the metadata `design:paramtypes` is added, and the dependency injection can do it's job. That is the exact reason to add the @Injectable() decorator on a service if this service has some dependencies itself.
     For example, Let's see the different variations of AppService in a root component,
     1. The below AppService can be injected in AppComponent without any problems. This is because there are no dependency services inside AppService.
         ```js
         export class AppService {
           constructor() {
             console.log('A new app service');
           }
         }
         ```
     2. The below AppService with dummy decorator and httpService can be injected in AppComponent without any problems. This is because meta information is generated with dummy decorator.
         ```js
         function SomeDummyDecorator() {
           return (constructor: Function) => console.log(constructor);
         }

         @SomeDummyDecorator()
         export class AppService {
           constructor(http: HttpService) {
             console.log(http);
           }
         }
         ```
     and the generated javascript code of above service has meta information about HttpService,
         ```js
         var AppService = (function () {
             function AppService(http) {
                 console.log(http);
             }
             AppService = __decorate([
                 core_1.Injectable(),
                 __metadata('design:paramtypes', [http_service_1.HttpService])
             ], AppService);
             return AppService;
         }());
         exports.AppService = AppService;
         ```
     3. The below AppService with @injectable decorator and httpService can be injected in AppComponent without any problems. This is because meta information is generated with Injectable decorator.
         ```js
         @Injectable({
           providedIn: 'root',
         })
         export class AppService {
           constructor(http: HttpService) {
             console.log(http);
           }
         }
         ```

254. ### What is an optional dependency?
     The optional dependency is a parameter decorator to be used on constructor parameters, which marks the parameter as being an optional dependency. Due to this, the DI framework provides null if the dependency is not found.
     For example, If you don't register a logger provider anywhere, the injector sets the value of logger(or logger service) to null in the below class.
     ```js
     import { Optional } from '@angular/core';

     constructor(@Optional() private logger?: Logger) {
       if (this.logger) {
         this.logger.log('This is an optional dependency message');
       } else {
         console.log('The logger is not registered');
       }
     }
     ```

255. ### What are the types of injector hierarchies?
     There are two types of injector hierarchies in Angular

     1. **ModuleInjector hierarchy:** It configure on a module level using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.
     2. **ElementInjector hierarchy:** It created implicitly at each DOM element. Also it is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().

269. ### How to set ngFor and ngIf on the same element?
     Sometimes you may need to both ngFor and ngIf on the same element but unfortunately you are going to encounter below template error.
     ```cmd
      Template parse errors: Can't have multiple template bindings on one element.
     ```
      In this case, You need to use either ng-container or ng-template.
      Let's say if you try to loop over the items only when the items are available, the below code throws an error in the browser
      ```html
      <ul *ngIf="items" *ngFor="let item of items">
        <li></li>
      </ul>
      ```
      and it can be fixed by
      ```html
      <ng-container *ngIf="items">
        <ul *ngFor="let item of items">
          <li></li>
        </ul>
      </ng-container>
      ```

270. ### What is host property in css?
     The `:host` pseudo-class selector is used to target styles in the element that hosts the component. Since the host element is in a parent component's template, you can't reach the host element from inside the component by other means.
     For example, you can create a border for parent element as below,
     ```js
     //Other styles for app.component.css
     //...
     :host {
       display: block;
       border: 1px solid black;
       padding: 20px;
     }
     ```

271. ### How do you get the current route?
     In Angular, there is an `url` property of router package to get the current route. You need to follow the below few steps,

     1. Import Router from @angular/router
      ```js
        import { Router } from '@angular/router';
      ```
     2. Inject router inside constructor
      ```js
      constructor(private router: Router ) {

      }
      ```
     3. Access url parameter
      ```js
        console.log(this.router.url); //  /routename
      ```

272. ### What is Component Test Harnesses?
     A component harness is a testing API around an Angular directive or component to make tests simpler by hiding implementation details from test suites. This can be shared between unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. The idea for component harnesses comes from the **PageObject** pattern commonly used for integration testing.

273. ### What is the benefit of Automatic Inlining of Fonts?
     During compile time, Angular CLI will download and inline the fonts that your application is using. This performance update speed up the first contentful paint(FCP) and this feature is enabled by default in apps built with version 11.

276. ### What is standalone component?
      A standalone component is a type of component which is not part of any Angular module. It provides a simplified way to build Angular applications.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

277. ### How to create a standalone component uing CLI command?

      Generate standalone component using CLI command as shown below
      ```bash
      ng generate component component-name --standalone
      ```
      On running the command standalone component is created.
      Here is the list of file created.
      
      1. `component-name.component.ts`
      2. `component-name.component.css`
      3. `component-name.component.spec`
      4. `component-name.component.html`
      
      Next need to update `app.module.ts` as shown below.

      ```typescript
      import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
      import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
      import { ComponentNameComponent } from './component-name/component-name.component';

      @NgModule({
        imports: [
          BrowserModule,
          ComponentNameComponent
        ],
        declarations: [AppComponent],
        bootstrap: [AppComponent],
      })
      export class AppModule {}
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

278. ### How to create a standalone component manually?
      To make existing component to standalone, then add `standalone: true` in `component-name.component.ts`
      as shown below

      ```typescript
      import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
      import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

      @Component({
        standalone: true,
        imports: [CommonModule],
        selector: 'app-standalone-component',
        templateUrl: './standalone-component.component.html',
        styleUrls: ['./standalone-component.component.css'],
      })
      export class ComponentNameComponent implements OnInit {
        constructor() {}

        ngOnInit() {}
      }
      ```
      Next need to update `app.module.ts` as shown below.

      ```typescript
      import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
      import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
      import { ComponentNameComponent } from './component-name/component-name.component';

      @NgModule({
        imports: [
          BrowserModule,
          ComponentNameComponent
        ],
        declarations: [AppComponent],
        bootstrap: [AppComponent],
      })
      export class AppModule {}
      ```

279. ### What is hydration?
      Hydration is the process that restores the server side rendered application on the client. This includes things like reusing the server rendered DOM structures, persisting the application state, transferring application data that was retrieved already by the server, and other processes.

      To enable hydration, we have to enable server side rendering or Angular Universal. Once enabled, we can add the following piece of code in the root component.
        
      ```typescript
      import {
        bootstrapApplication,
        provideClientHydration,
      } from '@angular/platform-browser';

      bootstrapApplication(RootCmp, {
        providers: [provideClientHydration()]
      });
      ```
      Alternatively we can add `providers: [provideClientHydration()]` in the App Module
      ```typescript
      import {provideClientHydration} from '@angular/platform-browser';
      import {NgModule} from '@angular/core';
      ​
      @NgModule({
        declarations: [RootCmp],
        exports: [RootCmp],
        bootstrap: [RootCmp],
        providers: [provideClientHydration()],
      })
      export class AppModule {}
      ```

280. ### What are Angular Signals?
      A signal is a wrapper around a value that can notify interested consumers when that value changes. Signals can contain any value, from simple primitives to complex data structures.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
  
281. ### Explain Angular Signals with an example. 
      In this example, we create a signal named `count` and initialize it with a value of 0. We then connect to the signal, allowing us to be notified whenever its value changes. Finally, we add a button that increments the count when clicked.

      When the button is clicked, the `incrementCount()` method is called. This method sets the new value of the `count` signal to 1. Objects connected to the signal (subscribers) are then notified of the change, and the updated value is displayed in the UI.

      In TypeScript file

      ```typescript
      import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
      import { signal, computed } from '@angular/core'; // Import from '@angular/core'

      @Component({
        selector: 'my-app',
        templateUrl: './app.component.html',
        styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
      })
      export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
        count = signal(0);
        doubleCount = computed(() => this.count() * 2);

        constructor() {}

        ngOnInit() {
          // Optional logging for debugging displayedCount changes
          // console.log('Displayed count changed to:', this.displayedCount());
        }

        incrementCount() {
          this.count.set(this.count() + 1);
        }

        decrementCount() {
          this.count.update((value) => Math.max(0, value - 1));
        }
      }
      ```
      In HTML file
      ```html
      <h1>Angular Signals Example</h1>

      <button (click)="incrementCount()" style="margin-right: 10px;">Increment Count</button>
      <button (click)="decrementCount()">Decrement Count</button>

      <p>Count: {{ count() }}</p>
      <p>Double Count: {{ doubleCount() }}</p>
      ```
