60. ### What are the various kinds of directives?
    There are mainly three kinds of directives:
    1. **Components** — These are directives with a template.
    2. **Structural directives** — These directives change the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements.
    3. **Attribute directives** — These directives change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive.

  **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

61. ### How do you create directives using CLI?
    You can use CLI command `ng generate directive` to create the directive class file. It creates the source file(`src/app/components/directivename.directive.ts`), the respective test file `.spec.ts` and declare the directive class file in root module.

  **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

62. ### Give an example for attribute directives?
    Let's take simple highlighter behavior as a example directive for DOM element. You can create and apply the attribute directive using below step:

    1. Create HighlightDirective class with the file name `src/app/highlight.directive.ts`. In this file, we need to import **Directive** from core library to apply the metadata and **ElementRef** in the directive's constructor to inject a reference to the host DOM element ,
        ```javascript
        import { Directive, ElementRef } from '@angular/core';

        @Directive({
          selector: '[appHighlight]'
        })
        export class HighlightDirective {
            constructor(el: ElementRef) {
               el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = 'red';
            }
        }
        ```
    2. Apply the attribute directive as an attribute to the host element(for example, <p>)
        ```javascript
        <p appHighlight>Highlight me!</p>
        ```
    3. Run the application to see the highlight behavior on paragraph element
        ```javascript
        ng serve
        ```

  137. ### What happens if I import the same module twice?
     If multiple modules imports the same module then angular evaluates it only once (When it encounters the module first time). It follows this condition even the module appears at any level in a hierarchy of imported NgModules.

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

138. ### How do you select an element with in a component template?
     You can use `@ViewChild` directive to access elements in the view directly. Let's take input element with a reference,

     ```html
     <input #uname>
     ```
     and define view child directive and access it in ngAfterViewInit lifecycle hook

     ```javascript
     @ViewChild('uname') input;

     ngAfterViewInit() {
       console.log(this.input.nativeElement.value);
     }
     ```

139. ### How do you detect route change in Angular?
     In Angular7, you can subscribe to router to detect the changes. The subscription for router events would be as below,

     ```javascript
     this.router.events.subscribe((event: Event) => {})
     ```
     Let's take a simple component to detect router changes

     ```javascript
     import { Component } from '@angular/core';
     import { Router, Event, NavigationStart, NavigationEnd, NavigationError } from '@angular/router';

     @Component({
         selector: 'app-root',
         template: `<router-outlet></router-outlet>`
     })
     export class AppComponent {

         constructor(private router: Router) {

             this.router.events.subscribe((event: Event) => {
                 if (event instanceof NavigationStart) {
                     // Show loading indicator and perform an action
                 }

                 if (event instanceof NavigationEnd) {
                     // Hide loading indicator and perform an action
                 }

                 if (event instanceof NavigationError) {
                     // Hide loading indicator and perform an action
                     console.log(event.error); // It logs an error for debugging
                 }
             });
        }
     }
     ```

140. ### How do you pass headers for HTTP client?
     You can directly pass object map for http client or create HttpHeaders class to supply the headers.

     ```javascript
     constructor(private _http: HttpClient) {}
     this._http.get('someUrl',{
        headers: {'header1':'value1','header2':'value2'}
     });

     (or)
     let headers = new HttpHeaders().set('header1', headerValue1); // create header object
     headers = headers.append('header2', headerValue2); // add a new header, creating a new object
     headers = headers.append('header3', headerValue3); // add another header

     let params = new HttpParams().set('param1', value1); // create params object
     params = params.append('param2', value2); // add a new param, creating a new object
     params = params.append('param3', value3); // add another param

     return this._http.get<any[]>('someUrl', { headers: headers, params: params })
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**


143. ### What is lazy loading?
     Lazy loading is one of the most useful concepts of Angular Routing. It helps us to download the web pages in chunks instead of downloading everything in a big bundle. It is used for lazy loading by asynchronously loading the feature module for routing whenever required using the property `loadChildren`. Let's load both `Customer` and `Order` feature modules lazily as below,
     ```javascript
     const routes: Routes = [
       {
         path: 'customers',
         loadChildren: () => import('./customers/customers.module').then(module => module.CustomersModule)
       },
       {
         path: 'orders',
         loadChildren: () => import('./orders/orders.module').then(module => module.OrdersModule)
       },
       {
         path: '',
         redirectTo: '',
         pathMatch: 'full'
       }
     ];
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**


145. ### How do you upgrade angular version?
     The Angular upgrade is quite easier using Angular CLI `ng update` command as mentioned below. For example, if you upgrade from Angular 7 to 8 then your lazy loaded route imports will be migrated to the new import syntax automatically.
     ```bash
     $ ng update @angular/cli @angular/core
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

146. ### What is Angular Material?
     Angular Material is a collection of Material Design components for Angular framework following the Material Design spec. You can apply Material Design very easily using Angular Material. The installation can be done through npm or yarn,
     ```bash
     npm install --save @angular/material @angular/cdk @angular/animations
     (OR)
     yarn add @angular/material @angular/cdk @angular/animations
     ```
     It supports the most recent two versions of all major browsers. The latest version of Angular material is 8.1.1

147. ### How do you upgrade location service of angularjs?
     If you are using `$location` service in your old AngularJS application, now you can use `LocationUpgradeModule`(unified location service) which puts the responsibilities of `$location` service to `Location` service in Angular. Let's add this module to `AppModule` as below,
     ```javascript
     // Other imports ...
     import { LocationUpgradeModule } from '@angular/common/upgrade';

     @NgModule({
       imports: [
         // Other NgModule imports...
         LocationUpgradeModule.config()
       ]
     })
     export class AppModule {}
     ```

148. ### What is NgUpgrade?
     NgUpgrade is a library put together by the Angular team, which you can use in your applications to mix and match AngularJS and Angular components and bridge the AngularJS and Angular dependency injection systems.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

149. ### How do you test Angular application using CLI?
     Angular CLI downloads and install everything needed with the Jasmine Test framework. You just need to run `ng test` to see the test results. By default this command builds the app in watch mode, and launches the `Karma test runner`. The output of test results would be as below,
     ```bash
     10% building modules 1/1 modules 0 active
     ...INFO [karma]: Karma v1.7.1 server started at http://0.0.0.0:9876/
     ...INFO [launcher]: Launching browser Chrome ...
     ...INFO [launcher]: Starting browser Chrome
     ...INFO [Chrome ...]: Connected on socket ...
     Chrome ...: Executed 3 of 3 SUCCESS (0.135 secs / 0.205 secs)
     ```
     **Note:** A chrome browser also opens and displays the test output in the "Jasmine HTML Reporter".

150. ### How to use polyfills in Angular application?
     The Angular CLI provides support for polyfills officially. When you create a new project with the ng new command, a `src/polyfills.ts` configuration file is created as part of your project folder. This file includes the mandatory and many of the optional polyfills as JavaScript import statements. Let's categorize the polyfills,

     1. **Mandatory polyfills:** These are installed automatically when you create your project with ng new command and the respective import statements enabled in 'src/polyfills.ts' file.
     2. **Optional polyfills:** You need to install its npm package and then create import statement in 'src/polyfills.ts' file.
        For example, first you need to install below npm package for adding web animations (optional) polyfill.
            ```bash
             npm install --save web-animations-js
            ```
        and create import statement in polyfill file.
            ```javascript
            import 'web-animations-js';
            ```

151. ### What are the ways to trigger change detection in Angular?
     You can inject either ApplicationRef or NgZone, or ChangeDetectorRef into your component and apply below specific methods to trigger change detection in Angular. i.e, There are 3 possible ways,

     1. **ApplicationRef.tick():** Invoke this method to explicitly process change detection and its side-effects. It check the full component tree.
     2. **NgZone.run(callback):** It evaluate the callback function inside the Angular zone.
     3. **ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges():** It detects only the components and it's children.

152. ### What are the differences of various versions of Angular?
     There are different versions of Angular framework. Let's see the features of all the various versions,

     1. **Angular 1:**
        * Angular 1 (AngularJS) is the first angular framework released in the year 2010.
        * AngularJS is not built for mobile devices.

          * @angular/http v2.3.0
          * @angular/router v3.3.0
        * The router package is already versioned 3 so to avoid confusion switched to Angular 4 version and skipped 3 version.
     4. **Angular 4:**
        * The compiler generated code file size in AOT mode is very much reduced.
        * With Angular 4 the production bundles size is reduced by hundreds of KB’s.
        * Animation features are removed from angular/core and formed as a separate package.
        * Supports Typescript 2.1 and 2.2.
        * Angular Universal

153. ### What are the security principles in angular?
     Below are the list of security principles in angular,

		1.	You should avoid direct use of the DOM APIs.
		2.  You should enable Content Security Policy (CSP) and configure your web server to return appropriate CSP HTTP headers.
		3.  You should Use the offline template compiler.
		4.  You should Use Server Side XSS protection.
		5.  You should Use DOM Sanitizer.
		6.  You should Preventing CSRF or XSRF attacks. 

	 **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

162. ### What is Angular security model for preventing XSS attacks?
     Angular treats all values as untrusted by default. i.e, Angular sanitizes and escapes untrusted values When a value is inserted into the DOM from a template, via property, attribute, style, class binding, or interpolation.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

163. ### What is the role of template compiler for prevention of XSS attacks?
     The offline template compiler prevents vulnerabilities caused by template injection, and greatly improves application performance. So it is recommended to use offline template compiler in production deployments without dynamically generating any template.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

164. ### What are the various security contexts in Angular?
     Angular defines the following security contexts for sanitization,

     1. **HTML:** It is used when interpreting a value as HTML such as binding to innerHtml.
     2. **Style:** It is used when binding CSS into the style property.
     3. **URL:** It is used for URL properties such as `<a href>`.
     4. **Resource URL:** It is a URL that will be loaded and executed as code such as `<script src>`.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

166. ### What is the purpose of innerHTML?
     The innerHtml is a property of HTML-Elements, which allows you to set it's html-content programmatically. Let's display the below html code snippet in a `<div>` tag as below using innerHTML binding,

     ```html
     <div [innerHTML]="htmlSnippet"></div>
     ```
     and define the htmlSnippet property from any component
     ```javascript
     export class myComponent {
       htmlSnippet: string = '<b>Hello World</b>, Angular';
     }
     ```
     Unfortunately this property could cause Cross Site Scripting (XSS) security bugs when improperly handled.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**


172. ### Is angular prevents http level vulnerabilities?
     Angular has built-in support for preventing http level vulnerabilities such as as cross-site request forgery (CSRF or XSRF) and cross-site script inclusion (XSSI). Even though these vulnerabilities need to be mitigated on server-side, Angular provides helpers to make the integration easier on the client side.
     1. HttpClient supports a token mechanism used to prevent XSRF attacks
     2. HttpClient library recognizes the convention of prefixed JSON responses(which non-executable js code with ")]}',\\n" characters) and automatically strips the string ")]}',\\n" from all responses before further parsing

 111. ### What is Angular Ivy?
      Angular Ivy is a new rendering engine for Angular. You can choose to opt in a preview version of Ivy from Angular version 8.

      1. You can enable ivy in a new project by using the --enable-ivy flag with the ng new command

          ```bash
          ng new ivy-demo-app --enable-ivy
          ```
      2. You can add it to an existing project by adding `enableIvy` option in the `angularCompilerOptions` in your project's `tsconfig.app.json`.

          ```javascript
          {
            "compilerOptions": { ... },
            "angularCompilerOptions": {
              "enableIvy": true
            }
          }
          ```

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

 112. ### What are the features included in ivy preview?
      You can expect below features with Ivy preview,

      1. Generated code that is easier to read and debug at runtime
      2. Faster re-build time
      3. Improved payload size
      4. Improved template type checking

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

 113. ### Can I use AOT compilation with Ivy?
      Yes, it is a recommended configuration. Also, AOT compilation with Ivy is faster. So you need set the default build options(with in angular.json) for your project to always use AOT compilation.

      ```javascript
      {
        "projects": {
          "my-project": {
            "architect": {
              "build": {
                "options": {
                  ...
                  "aot": true,
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
      ```

   196. ### How do you use jquery in Angular?
     You can use jquery in Angular using 3 simple steps,
     1. **Install the dependency:** At first, install the jquery dependency using npm
         ```cmd
            npm install --save jquery
         ```
     2. **Add the jquery script:** In Angular-CLI project, add the relative path to jquery in the angular.json file.
         ```javascript
         "scripts": [
            "node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"
         ]
         ```
     3. **Start using jquery:** Define the element in template. Whereas declare the jquery variable and apply CSS classes on the element.
         ```html
         <div id="elementId">
           <h1>JQuery integration</h1>
         </div>
         ```
         ```javascript
         import {Component, OnInit} from '@angular/core';

         declare var $: any; // (or) import * as $ from 'jquery';

         @Component({
           selector: 'app-root',
           templateUrl: './app.component.html',
           styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
         })
         export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
           ngOnInit(): void {
             $(document).ready(() => {
               $('#elementId').css({'text-color': 'blue', 'font-size': '150%'});
             });
           }
         }
         ```

199. ### How can I use SASS in angular project?
     When you are creating your project with angular cli, you can use `ng new`command. It generates all your components with predefined sass files.
     ```javascript
     ng new My_New_Project --style=sass
     ```
     But if you are changing your existing style in your project then use `ng set` command,
     ```javascript

203. ### What is index property in ngFor directive?
     The index property of the NgFor directive is used to return the zero-based index of the item in each iteration. You can capture the index in a template input variable and use it in the template.

     For example, you can capture the index in a variable named indexVar and displays it with the todo's name using ngFor directive as below.
     ```javascript
     <div *ngFor="let todo of todos; let i=index">{{i + 1}} - {{todo.name}}</div>
     ```

204. ### What is the purpose of ngFor trackBy?
     The main purpose of using *ngFor with trackBy option is performance optimization. Normally if you use NgFor with large data sets, a small change to one item by removing or adding an item, can trigger a cascade of DOM manipulations. In this case, Angular sees only a fresh list of new object references and to replace the old DOM elements with all new DOM elements. You can help Angular to track which items added or removed by providing a `trackBy` function which takes the index and the current item as arguments and needs to return the unique identifier for this item.

     For example, lets set trackBy to the trackByTodos() method
     ```javascript
     <div *ngFor="let todo of todos; trackBy: trackByTodos">
       ({{todo.id}}) {{todo.name}}
     </div>
     ```
     and define the trackByTodos method,
     ```javascript
     trackByTodos(index: number, item: Todo): number { return todo.id; }
     ```

205. ### What is the purpose of ngSwitch directive?
     **NgSwitch** directive is similar to JavaScript switch statement which displays one element from among several possible elements, based on a switch condition. In this case only the selected element placed into the DOM. It has been used along with `NgSwitch`, `NgSwitchCase` and `NgSwitchDefault` directives.

     For example, let's display the browser details based on selected browser using ngSwitch directive.
     ```javascript
     <div [ngSwitch]="currentBrowser.name">
       <chrome-browser    *ngSwitchCase="'chrome'"    [item]="currentBrowser"></chrome-browser>
       <firefox-browser   *ngSwitchCase="'firefox'"     [item]="currentBrowser"></firefox-browser>
       <opera-browser     *ngSwitchCase="'opera'"  [item]="currentBrowser"></opera-browser>
       <safari-browser     *ngSwitchCase="'safari'"   [item]="currentBrowser"></safari-browser>
       <ie-browser  *ngSwitchDefault           [item]="currentItem"></ie-browser>
     </div>
     ```

206. ### Is it possible to do aliasing for inputs and outputs?
     Yes, it is possible to do aliasing for inputs and outputs in two ways.
     1. **Aliasing in metadata:** The inputs and outputs in the metadata aliased using a colon-delimited (:) string with the directive property name on the left and the public alias on the right. i.e. It will be in the format of propertyName:alias.
         ```javascript
         inputs: ['input1: buyItem'],
         outputs: ['outputEvent1: completedEvent']
         ```
     2. **Aliasing with @Input()/@Output() decorator:** The alias can be specified for the property name by passing the alias name to the @Input()/@Output() decorator.i.e. It will be in the form of @Input(alias) or @Output(alias).
         ```javascript
         @Input('buyItem') input1: string;
         @Output('completedEvent') outputEvent1 = new EventEmitter<string>();
         ```
